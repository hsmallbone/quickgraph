## Home Page Overview

Upon logging in, you'll be greeted by the personalised home page, which contains the following sections:

1. High-Level Metrics
2. Activity Feed

### 1. High-Level Metrics

This section provides a snapshot of your overall progress across all projects. It includes the following key metrics:

- **Number of Projects**: The total number of projects you have created or participated in.
- **Number of Complete Projects**: The total number of projects that have reached 100% completion.
- **Dataset Items Saved**: The total number of dataset items you have saved across all projects.
- **Entity Annotations Made**: The total number of entity annotations you have made.
- **Relation Annotations Made**: The total number of relation annotations you have made.
- **Comments Made**: The total number of comments you have posted on projects.

### 2. Activity Feed

The activity feed allows you to stay informed about recent activities on projects your manage or are involved in, including updates made by you and other collaborators. The feed displays the following information:

- **Comments**: Shows recent comments made by you and your collaborators on projects.
- **Flags**: Displays any flags raised by you or your collaborators on projects or annotations, indicating issues that require attention or further discussion.

You can click on an activity to navigate directly to the relevant project or dataset item for quick access.

Below are two items from the user's activity feed: a flag application and a comment post. Here, clicking `Project MaintIE Project - Chunk 3` will go to the project dashboard, or `view` will go to the exact dataset flagged or commented upon.

# Dataset Preannotation

:::caution
A visual quick reference guide of this page is coming soon.
:::

The fourth stage of project creation involves selecting a preannotation resource. Preannotating standard datasets can significantly accelerate the annotation process. For more information, refer to [Concept: Resources - Preannotations](/concepts/resources#preannotations).

## Preannotation of standard datasets

:::warning
Due to system improvements, preannotation of standard datasets is currently unavailable. Please refer to the [Planned Features](../../../planned-features) roadmap to stay informed about this feature.

## Preannotation of annotated datasets

If an `annotated` dataset was selected in the second stage (**dataset**), this step requires users to specify whether preannotations should be set as `accepted` or `suggested`. Choosing `suggested` means users must review and approve all preannotations applied to the project dataset. The default selection will align with the settings of the preannotated dataset.

:::tip
It is generally recommended to stick with the default option set for the preannotated dataset.

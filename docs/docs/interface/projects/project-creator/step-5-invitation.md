# Inviting Collaborators

The final configuration step involves inviting collaborators, who play a crucial role in curating high-quality corpora for machine learning or NLP tasks. It is optional to invite collaborators, as projects can be created with any number of users.

## Inviting users to the Project

To invite users to your project, simply enter a comma-separated list of usernames and click `Add` (Figure 1). QuickGraph will search its user database and send invitations to those with matching usernames. Upon successful matches, a list of pending users will be displayed. You can remove any users from this list by clicking `Remove` before advancing to the [review stage](./step-6-review) of the project creation process.

## Managing Collaborators in the Project Dashboard

Invited users can be managed within the project dashboard, where their dataset item scopes need to be assigned. At any time, the project manager (_project creator_) can remove or disable users. Additionally, the project manager can invite more collaborators directly from the [project dashboard](../dashboard/section-4-annotators.md). This flexibility allows for seamless collaboration and efficient project management.

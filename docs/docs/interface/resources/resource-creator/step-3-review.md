# Review

Once the resource has been uploaded or entered, if it is valid and the required details have been set, it can be created. The Resource Review step will highlight which steps have been validated or those with errors which require fixing. Clicking `Create` will create the resource and redirect you to the [Resources Explorer](../resources-explorer).

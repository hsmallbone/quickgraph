# Add/Remove Data

Every project in QuickGraph has data that can be annotated. To add or remove data to an established project:

1. Go to the projects dashboard and navigate to the [dataset](/interface/dashboard/dataset) tab.

To add additional project data:

1. Click on the _add data_ button. This requires a JSON or CSV containing additional data. If you have external identifiers that are used to track documents, ensure the structure is adhered to when uploading.

To remove existing data:

1. Click on one or more entries in the data table to mark them for deletion. **Warning: Documents are permanently deleted.**

**Note that documents will be available to all project annotators**

# Project Settings

There are various settings that can be modified for existing QuickGraph projects. In the project dashboard tab [Settings](/interface/dashboard/settings), the following settings can be modified:

## Project name and description

## Annotation propagation

Annotation propagation can be disabled for all project annotators. This can be a good idea for new projects where annotators are not familiar with the corpus or ontology, hence it could be erroneous to propagate annotations that are uncertain.

## Preprocessing

Although it cannot be modified after project creation, the project settings show the preprocessing stages applied to the project at creation time. This can be useful for reproducibility of the original corpus.

Projects can also be deleted from this dashboard tab. Note project deletion is permanent.

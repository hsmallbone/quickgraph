# Annotate your project

ðŸ‘‹ In this section of the tutorial we will learn the basics of entity and relation annotation in QuickGraph using the project we created in the [previous section](./step-1-create-a-project.md). Let's get started!

## Navigating to the project annotation view

There are two ways you can navigate to the [**Annotation View**](../interface/projects/annotation-view) of a project:

- From the [**Project Dashboard**](../interface/projects/dashboard/section-1-overview.md) - click the `Annotate` button on the top right hand side
- From the [**Projects page**](../interface/projects/projects-explorer) - click the `Annotate` button on the project's card

After navigating to the [Annotation View](../interface/projects/annotation-view), it should look like Figure 1 below.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the [Annotation View](../interface/projects/annotation-view).

## Applying your first annotations

Let's dive into applying our first annotations! First, we'll apply entity annotations individually and then see how we can propagate unambiguous entity labels across the dataset to speed up annotation using QuickGraph's propagation functionality. Following this, we'll apply relations between the entities annotations we've created.

### Entity annotation

    alt="Tutorial Project - Token Selection"
    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 2: Example of Token Span Selection.</figcaption>
</figure>

To annotate entities, first, you simply need to click (or click and drag) across the words (tokens) in a dataset item - this will constitute a "selected span" (Figure 2). The background color of the words will change to indicate the selection. Once selected, you can apply an entity label to the selection by either clicking on an item in the **Sidebar Entity Hiearchy** (Figure 3) or selecting an entity label in the **Label Search Modal** (Figure 4). To find out more, visit the [Annotation View](../interface/projects/annotation-view).

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>

    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Example of Applying an Entity to a Selected Span via the Sidebar Entity Hierarchy.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
Using the Sidebar Entity Hierarchy is useful for small to medium sized entity ontology resources, however if a significant number of entities are being applied, the **Label Search Modal** can be faster due to its ability to display entity label histories and rapidly find labels based on partial search strings.

:::

<!-- #### Keyboard Digit Shortcut

:::tip
Using the keyboard digit (`1`, `11`, `21`, ...) shortcut is optimal if your project doesn't use an entity ontology resource that has lots of levels. Otherwise, it is challenging to recall the correct sequence of digits that correspond with the desired label.

  <figcaption>Figure 4: Example of Applying an Entity to a Selected Span via the Label Search Modal.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
Using the Label Search Modal (`ctrl + k`) is optimal if you have a very large resource or the items in the resource are complex and require the user to see their `descriptions` and `example terms`.
:::

<!-- Add reference: hence a triple ([what is a triple?](/guides/explaining-triples))  -->

Before we can create our first relation, and hence a triple, we need to ensure we have at least two entities in the dataset item as they will act as `source` and `target`. Let's apply the entity type `Character` to the word `Alice` in the first document. To find out more about the actions and contextual information in Figure 5 - visit [Annotation View](../interface/projects/annotation-view).

**Step 2:** Apply a single entity annotation of type `Character` to the word `Alice` in the first dataset item.

    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 5: Example of 'Character' Entity Label Applied to the Word 'Alice'.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Entity propagation

Looking closely at the five dataset items in our projects corpus, we can see that there are lots of unambigous terms/phrases such as proper nouns (Alice, White Rabbit, ...). Now, imagine we had a corpus with 100-1000x more data - repeatedly annotating frequently occurring unambiguous words would be arduous and unproductive. To combat this, QuickGraph uses the concept of [Annotation Propagation](../interface/projects/annotation-view) to rapidly annotate such cases. Let's see how this works for the proper noun `Alice`.

<!-- Add reference: [annotation propagation](../interface/annotation#annotation-propagation) -->

Click on the entity we applied to the word 'Alice', this reveals a handy context menu that contains atomic annotation operations that can be performed.

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img
    src={require('../../static/img/tutorial/annotate-your-project/entity_propagation_v1.gif').default}
    alt="Tutorial Project - Example entity propagation."
    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 6: Example of Propagating the Entity Label 'Character' Across All Instances of the Word 'Alice'.</figcaption>
</figure>

By clicking on the `Apply All` icon, we can propagate the entity type `Character` to all instances of `Alice` in our corpus (Figure 6). This action can significantly reduce annotation effort and potential for error by improving consistency when working with large sets of documents and/or large ontologies.

After applying this action, our five documents will look like those in Figure 7. Here, we can see a opaque entity applied to all instances of `Alice`. These opaque entities are called `weak` or `suggested` to denote that they have been applied, but not verified, by the annotator.

**Step 3:** Click on the entity label you created in Step 2 and then click on the `Apply All` icon.

:::tip
Why do we use weak/suggested labels? Imagine if we had a general corpus of mixed documents, we could have the word `bank` which could for 75% of the time represent the entity type `Organisation`, however in the context of a `river bank` it could be another type of class. Hence, entities need to be `accepted` after they are propagated. For this tutorial, we'll leave this here - to learn more go [here](../interface/projects/annotation-view#annotation-propagation).

</figure>

Before we move on, let's add a few more entities to the first dataset item so relations can be created. The dataset item should look like that below (you could add more entities or apply different ones, but we'll leave them for now).

**Step 4:** Apply more entity annotations to words or phrases in the collection of dataset items. These can be nonesense, it's just to get familiar with QuickGraph's annotation UI/UX.

    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 8: Example Entity Annotated Dataset Item.</figcaption>

### Relation annotation

<!-- either pressing `ctrl+m` or -->

Creating relations between entities is simple in QuickGraph. First switch annotation mode into **Relation Mode** by clicking on the [Entity/Relation Toggle switch](../interface/projects/annotation-view#annotation-mode-toggle) in the left hand sidebar. While in the relation mode, only accepted (silver) entities will be visible - to show weak entities you'll need to accept them first. To create your first relation, select a source entity (this will begin to flash to signify it as the source) and then select the target entity you wish to create a relation between.

:::tip
The border of the currently selected dataset item will change to indicate the dataset item you're interacting with in relation mode.
:::

Let's create our first relation - click on the source entity `Alice (Character)` and target entity `sister (Character)`. You should see a relation selector popover appear after the target is selected. Select the `Knows` relation type from the relation selector by clicking the green circular checkmark (Figure 9).

**Step 5:** Create the relation `Knows` between `Alice (Character)` and `sister (Character)`. If you're missing entities, create them.

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img
    src={require('../../static/img/tutorial/annotate-your-project/relation_apply_v1.gif').default}
    alt="Tutorial Project - Example Relation Apply"
    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 9: Example of 'Knows' Relation Label Applied between the Words 'Alice' and 'sister` with the Entity Type 'Character'.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
Just like entities, relations can be propagated and have similar atomic annotation operations - click [here](../interface/projects/annotation-view#annotation-propagation) for more information.
:::

You'll now see a few new things - the created relation in triple form in the [Relation Viewer](../interface/projects/annotation-view#relation-viewer) in the sidebar, and a new icon on the right hand side of the document symbolising a relation exists on the dataset item.

Common to other applications, QuickGraph purposely does not render links between relations _over the document_ as it grows uncontrollably for complex annotations. Instead, the relation viewer makes it easy to see what has been annotated whilst allowing atomic operations to be easily performed.

Before we save the item, let's add a few more relations (Figure 10) so we can better explore the powerful [Project Dashboard](./category/dashboard) features.

**Step 6:** Create more relation annotations between words or phrases. These can be nonesense, it's just to get familiar with QuickGraph's annotation UI/UX.

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img
    src={require('../../static/img/tutorial/annotate-your-project/dataset_item_with_relations_v1.png').default}
    alt="Tutorial Project - Example of relation annotated dataset item"
    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />
  <figcaption>Figure 10: Example of Dataset Item with Relations.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now that we've got a few relations created, let's save the dataset item to mark it as complete (this also computes the inter-annotator agreement when you have collaborator). Simply click the save icon in the [dataset item action tray](../interface/projects/annotation-view#action-tray) which will turn green to signify the document has been saved and you'll see progress made on the linear progress bar in the top [toolbar](../interface/projects/annotation-view#2-toolbar) (Figure 11). When the dataset item is saved, it is excluded from annotation propagation events. However, dataset items can be 'unsaved' at any time.

**Step 7:** Save one or more dataset items by double clinking the `save button` in the left hand sidebar or by clicking the `save button` on the individual dataset items.

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img
    src={require('../../static/img/tutorial/annotate-your-project/saved_dataset_item_v1.png').default}
    alt="Tutorial Project - Example of a saved dataset item"
    style={{height:"100%"}}
    />

## Wrap up

ðŸ¥³ Throughout this section, you've navigated the fundamental aspects of annotation with QuickGraph such as applying and propagating entities and relations. Having completed the annotation of our initial document, it's an apt moment to pause and assess our accomplishments. Let's visit the project's dashboard to gain insights into the progress we've made so far.

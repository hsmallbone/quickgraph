# Building an Entity Tagger with Flair

In this short guide, we're going to take the QuickGraph download format and use it to train a named entity recognition (NER) model using the popular Python library [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair).

## Building the corpus

## Model Training and Evaluation

## Model Inference

Using QuickGraph allows rapid entity annotation and by using high-performing, low-code, APIs like Flair, NER models can be developed extremely quickly.

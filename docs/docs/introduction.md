Welcome to **QuickGraph**, an advanced annotation application built to produce high-quality training data for knowledge graph extraction from text-based content. Designed with a focus on collaboration, QuickGraph enables users to effortlessly annotate entities and relations together. Our solution streamlines complex annotation tasks with a user-centric design, minimises repetitive actions, and provides a seamless workflow for the entire annotation process.

## Guiding Principles

QuickGraph is built upon a set of core principles that emphasise user experience, efficiency, and collaboration:

- **Self-Contained Solution**: Minimise or eliminate the need for third-party software by offering an all-encompassing platform for your annotation needs.
- **End-to-End Annotation Workflow**: Facilitate the complete annotation process, from data input and gold-standard corpus construction, all within a single application.
- **Seamless Interaction with Complex Ontologies**: Effortlessly handle large and intricate ontologies using intuitive features that simplify even the most demanding tasks.
- **User-Focused Minimalist Design**: Prioritise ease of use and functionality by incorporating a clean, straightforward design that promotes user engagement.

## Key Features

QuickGraph boasts a range of powerful features designed to enhance the user experience and streamline the annotation process:

- **Collaborative Annotation**: Work together with your team to annotate entities and relations, improving efficiency and accuracy
- **Customizable Ontologies**: Personalise ontologies to suit your project's specific needs, ensuring flexibility and adaptability
- **Real-Time Updates**: Stay informed about your team's progress with live updates, ensuring everyone remains on the same page
<!-- - **Version Control**: Keep track of changes and revisions to annotations, making it easier to compare, merge, and revert when needed -->
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Quickly locate relevant projects or annotations using a comprehensive set of search and filtering options
<!-- - **Integration with Machine Learning**: Seamlessly incorporate machine learning models to facilitate pre-annotation, active learning, and validation of results -->
- **Export in Multiple Formats**: Easily export annotated data in a variety of formats to ensure compatibility with a wide range of tools and platforms

<!-- Relations are applied between entities not tokens, so rich formats of structure can be created. -->

<!-- Rather than overwhelm, QuickGraph shows you what you need, when you need it. QuickGraph has been built from extensive experience annotating technical corpora with large and complex hierarchical ontologies. -->

<!-- This powerful and dynamic tool eliminates the need to use third-party software like Neo4J or Gephi prematurely, by offering users rich filtering and aggregation functionality to explore the relationships and structures within the project's data. -->

<!-- ## Key Features

QuickGraph is packed full of features that support the annotation workflow for knowledge graph extraction. The key features include:

**Collaborative Annotation**

Adjudication, visualisation, management, discussions

**Support for Large and/or Complex Annotation Ontologies**

- Hierachical entities, ontologies with any arbritary depth. Full support

3. Reusability
   QuickGraph is designed to support reusability of resources such as ontologies and datasets across multiple projects, reducing redundancy.
4. Speed

QuickGraph utilises the concept of annotation propagation to empower users to rapidly annotate content.

...

Many tools do not support the iterative lifecycle of annotation that is paramount to converging to an agreed upon annotation schema and the subsequent creation of a gold standard corpus. For example, they typically do not support dynamic schemas (e.g. permit modifications whilst annotating), adding additional data to projects (e.g. they require many disparate projects which makes it challenging to manage data and progress as well as assemble insights and gold standard), they lack insight into complex annotation tasks like hierarchical entity and relation annotation, they require external tools to be used to preprocess data, etc.

**Collaborative**

- Acquiring high-quality datasets for knowledge graph extraction usually requires the efforts from multiple people. QuickGraph supports collaborative annotation.

Hierarchical entity and relation annotation.

Rapid annotation via annotation propagation.

Minimalist interface design.

Nested, hierarchical, multi-label entities and relations.

Relations are assigned to the entities not the tokens.

**Responsive**

- QuickGraph's responsive UI adapts to all screen sizes allowing you to annotate from anywhere on any device. Instead of being chained to your desktop, you can annotate while you're on the bus or laying on the couch.

**Built in dataset preprocessing and preannotation**

- Instead of manually or programmatically preprocessing your data before annotation, QuickGraph's no-code preprocessing and preannotation allows you to pre-treat your raw data without any external hassles. -->

## Getting Started

Before diving into the application, we highly recommend that you follow our step-by-step [Tutorial](./category/introduction-tutorial). This comprehensive guide will walk you through the core features and functionalities of QuickGraph, providing you with hands-on experience and practical knowledge to get the most out of the tool.

ðŸ“š To begin the tutorial, navigate to the [Tutorial section of our documentation site](/category/introduction-tutorial).

As you progress through the tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Create and manage projects
- Annotate entities and relations
- Collaborate with other annotators
<!-- - Preprocess and pre-annotate datasets -->
- Export and use your annotated data

Once you've completed the tutorial, you'll be well-prepared to tackle your annotation projects with confidence and efficiency. If you encounter any issues or have questions along the way, don't hesitate to [reach out to us](./contact) or consult our comprehensive documentation for assistance.

We're excited to have you on board, and we look forward to seeing the incredible work you'll accomplish with our annotation application!

<!-- ## Use cases

- Creating gold-standard corpora from scratch
- Fixing complex distantly annotated datasets like OntoNotes/FIGER.
- text graph / dialogue state; (future feature will allow dummy node to ground stuff; this should support AMR annotation natively - write a guide on this if it becomes possible)

### Open/Closed Information Extraction

### Dialogue

### Meaning Representation

## Comparison

There are various commerical and open-source annotations tools that exist such as Prodigy, LightTag, INCEPTION. Each having their own merits. QuickGraph differentiates itself by being purpose built for supporting graph construction for all NLP tasks whilst being fast, having an easy-to-use UI, and powerful features. -->

<!-- ## Open-source version of QuickGraph

An open-source version of QuickGraph was released under (LICENSE TYPE) accompanying the conference paper [CONFERENCE PAPER] in 2022. QuickGraph at https://quickgraph.tech is derivative of this with significant improvements in all areas of the application. -->

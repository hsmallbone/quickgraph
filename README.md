QuickGraph: A Rapid Annotation Tool for Knowledge Graph Extraction from Technical Text</h2>
</div>
QuickGraph is a rapid multi-user annotation tool for multi-task information tasks. It is built on the full-stack web-based framework MERN (MongoDB-Express-React-Node). A live demonstration of the tool can be found at https://quickgraph.nlp-tlp.org and a systems demonstration video at https://youtu.be/DTWrR67-nCU. An overview of how to use QuickGraph can be found [here](About.md).

## Getting started

QuickGraph can be built using Docker. Before doing so please add a secure token to the `TOKEN_SECRET` field in `/server/.env` for user password hashing and salting. After this, in the repository root directory, execute:

```
$ make run
```

or alternatively:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

## Issues, Bugs and Feedback
QuickGraph is currently under active development with only a single developer, so bugs are still being squashed. If you come across any issues, bugs or have any general feedback please feel free to reach out (email: tyler.bikaun@research.uwa.edu.au). Alternatively, feel free to raise a issue, or better yet, a pull request ðŸ™‚.

### Known Issues/Bugs
Annotation with QuickGraph under entity annotation, and entity and closed relation annotation has been widely tested for single users, however a few bugs still exist in the multi-user environment and for open relation annotation. The following are currently being resolved:
- [ ] Download summary for multiple users not showing correct summaries for each user
- [ ] Inter-annotator agreement not aggregating correctly
- [ ] Plots for open relation annotation do not work
- [ ] Graph performance for thousands of nodes/edges
- [ ] Contiguous token selection for pages with massive numbers of tokens is slow
- [ ] Relation badges when accepting all suggested relations look similar to those that are accepted

## Future features
- [ ] Plots in dashboard overview to be improved to include distribution of entities, relations and triples created by each user rather than aggregating over all users
- [ ] Improved document distribution method(s)
- [ ] Extend open relation extraction for multi-user environments
- [ ] Allow ontologies to be dynamically modified (CRUD, colour scheme, descriptions, etc.)
- [ ] Permit projects to be inititated from QuickGraph download artifacts
- [ ] Add option for downloading triples and entities together
- [ ] Improve graph performance, interaction and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Enhanced identification of suggested relations

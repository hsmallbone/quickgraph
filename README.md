## üåü Overview

QuickGraph is a collaborative annotation tool for rapid multi-task information extraction. It features entity and relation propagation which mimics weak supervision, and uses text clustering to aid with annotation consistency.

## ‚ú® Features

- Entity and relation propagation
- Text clustering for annotation consistency
- Multi-user collaboration support
- Real-time knowledge graph creation from annotations
- Interactive visualization
- Comprehensive analytics dashboard

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=flat&logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://www.docker.com/)
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://reactjs.org/)
[![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-005571?style=flat&logo=fastapi)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
[![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=flat&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Node.js 16+ (for local development only)
- Python 3.10+ (for local development only)

### General Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nlp-tlp/quickgraph.git
cd quickgraph
```

2. Build and run using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The services will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- Documentation: http://localhost:4000
- MongoDB: localhost:27018

### Development Installation

Need to run client and fastapi server locally; can run docker container for mongodb separately. But FastAPI is run in `./server` through `uvicorn src.quickgraph.main:app --reload`. Client is run from `./client` via `npm run dev`. Both of these need to have local `.env` files set up as outlined below.

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy sample environment files
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```

For `client/.env` these can remain as defaults

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_DOC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

For `server/.env`, create a atlas or locally hosted mongodb:
```
MONGODB__DATABASE_NAME="your_database_name"
MONGODB__URI="mongodb+srv://..."
AUTH__SECRET_KEY="your_secret"
```

## üèó Architecture

QuickGraph consists of four main components:
- Frontend: Vite/React application
- Backend: FastAPI REST API
- Documentation: Docusaurus static site
- Database: MongoDB

## üéØ Usage

Once the docker containers have been set up, simply run `docker compose up` then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use QuickGraph.
